hello tucker

this is where you can type things that make up your very own personal website.

there's lots that you can do.
you can ~~cross things out~~, or make things *slanted* or **big**. You can even ***do both***

you can put images here too! ![some random maths work](/images/maths.jpeg) or put a link to somewhere else [like my website](www.gabrieldwyer.com)

it looks a little bit plain at the moment, but I know that you'll have a lot of ideas of what to add to it.

it also won't be as easy or as immediate as your other programming stuff, but sometimes good things are hard!

sometimes your changes will take a few seconds to get here, be patient!
